*It is frontend part of project. Backend REST API for Currency Exchange Simulator is located under the link: https://github.com/jmysliv/CurrencyExchangeSimulator.*

## About Project
Currency Exchange Simulator is mobile app for exchange market enthusiasts. Firstly, application allows users to check current exchange rate of many currencies, and also visualizes how exchange rate changed in time. Secondly, Currency Exchange Simulator let users feel like a real investors, they can test buy currencies in order to make a profit like on real exchange market. It's a perfect app for those who are interested in economy and would like to test their analytics skills. What's important in app you don't invest with real money so you don't have to risk financial lost like on the real exchange market with real money.

### Technology
To developed mobile app I used Flutter framework. It is my second mobile app created using this framework. To seperate business logic from presentation I went for BLoC pattern which worked great in my [previous Flutter project](https://github.com/jmysliv/na-stok-app) and is perfect for state management. My personal goal during implementation was to learn how to use Flutter animations. After the initial problems I found the whole idea quite logical and I really enjoyed making animations for this app. 

### Yet to do
Most important thing is to deploy backend on DigitalOcean, because now using app is possible only when user runs server locally. Then I would like to try build and release app in Google Play Store. I never done it before, so it would be perfect oportunity, to learn something new.
